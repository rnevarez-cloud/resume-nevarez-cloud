## The Cloud Resume Challenge - Azure
---
After landing a role as a Site Reliability Engineer at Koncert, I started to look at ways I could grow my skills as an IT professional. Rather than look for an instructional course, I decided to gather inspiration for a project I could take up to learn new technology. This is when I stumbled upon the [Cloud Resume Challenge for Azure](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/). 

## HTML, CSS, Static Website, and Javascript

I decided to skip step 1 since I would need to spend a significant amount of time studying for the AZ-900 certification. In the future, I hope to study and pass this exam. For now, I focused on building everything in Azure.

While I was already familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I had no idea how to deploy code to Azure or integrate it with a cloud-hosted database. It was new territory for me, but I was excited to see what I could come up with. 

The goal was to make an exact replica of my existing resume, layout and all, but with a visitor counter at the top of the page. I also wanted to tell the user which view they were, so I had to figure out how to display an ordinal number. My experience with JavaScript outside of React was limited, so I had to do some research before I could implement this onto my site. For this initial test, I wasn't worried about how I would connect the page to an external database. My initial mockup for the counter looked like this:

<details>

<summary><b>Code Snippet</b></summary>

```js
const english_ordinal_rules = new Intl.PluralRules("en", {type: "ordinal"});
const suffixes = {
    one: "st",
    two: "nd",
    few: "rd",
    other: "th"
};

function ordinal(number) {
    const category = english_ordinal_rules.select(number);
    console.log(category)
    const suffix = suffixes[category];
    return (number + suffix);
}

var counter = document.querySelector(".counter");
var visitCount = localStorage.getItem("page_view");

if (visitCount) {
    visitCount = Number(visitCount) + 1;
    localStorage.setItem("page_view", visitCount);
  } else {
    visitCount = 1;
    localStorage.setItem("page_view", 1);
  }
 
displayCount = ordinal(visitCount)

counter.innerHTML = displayCount;
```
</details>

When testing this in my local environment, it worked out great. I was able to load my resume and see the number counter increment every time I loaded the page. The next step was to upload these files to Azure as a static website. I followed [this documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website) from Microsoft to complete this. 

I skipped steps 5. HTTPS and 6. DNS to focus on getting the backend up and running.

## Database, API, Python

Before I started the Cloud Resume challenge, I worked on a React.js project to backup all of my Instagram posts. This required working with a database (sqllite3), Python, and setting up an API through Node.js. Although I never finished work on this project, the experience I gained there allowed me to have a better sense of direction here. Rather than keep my resume in a static website, I decided to migrate the site to a React.js instance. This was an easy process, and it allowed me to link a GitHub repository for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). I could make changes to the project files in VS Code, commit those changes to my GitHub repository, and deploy them to Azure. Azure took care of setting up the GitHub actions to allow me to deploy the code, which made it that much easier. 

The Cloud Resume challenge reccomends setting up an Azure function to connect to a database, so I spun up a new Python function and Azure Cosmos DB and got to work. This was the hardest part of the challenge to me. I ran into trouble [querying the Table API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/table/tutorial-query), so I tried following [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-cosmosdb-v2-output?tabs=python-v2%2Cisolated-process%2Cnodejs-v4%2Cextensionv4&pivots=programming-language-python) from Microsoft to read and write data to my Cosmos DB. I didn't understand what the collection_name was, and I whenever I would try to update the database, I would get an error about the partition key being [incorrect](https://www.google.com/search?q=partitionkey+extracted+from+document+doesn%27t+match+the+one+specified+in+the+header&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS859US859&oq=PartitionKey+extracted+from+document+doesn%27t+match+the+one+specified+in+the+header&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDwgAEEUYOxiRAhiABBiKBTIPCAAQRRg7GJECGIAEGIoFMgYIARBFGEAyBggCEEUYPDIGCAMQRRg8MgYIBBBFGDzSAQczMjRqMGo5qAIAsAIB&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Many forum posts online also referenced the Python v1 programming model instead of the v2 model, so they were not as helpful.

After many hours of troubleshooting, I decided to go ahead and delete my old Cosmos DB for Table and deployed an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. Thankfully, this ended up working! I was able to connect to my database, read the current viewer count, and increment it by one. I then deployed my code to an Azure Python Function. How exciting!

                  outputDocument: func.Out[func.Document],
                  req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:

    count = inputDocument[0]
    logging.info(inputDocument[0].to_json())

    current_count = inputDocument[0]['count']
    logging.info(f'Current count: {current_count}')

    current_count = int(current_count) + 1
    count['count'] =  current_count

    outputDocument.set(count)

    logging.info(f'New page count: {current_count}')

    return func.HttpResponse(
        str(current_count)
    )
```

After getting the Azure function deployed, I updated my site to query the API endpoint every time it is loaded. I also added some code to ensure that the page counter would not increment if the user refreshed the page or navigated to a different area.

## HTTPS and DNS

After dealing with the monster that was database and Python function, it was nice to work on something easier. Setting up a custom domain for the Azure Function was a piece of cake. I currently manage nevarez.cloud with Cloudflare, so all it took was setting up the appropriate DNS records to get a custom domain configured. One of the other benefits of moving my site from an Azure Static Website to ReactJS was the ability to add a custom domain while using Cloudflare as my DNS. This was simply not possible with a [Static Website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1665729/static-website-custom-domain-missing-ssl).

## Retrospective
This project was not easy, but it was very fulfilling. I went from having no experience with Azure to setting up a Static Web App that interfaces with an Azure Function API to retrieve/update a record in a Cosmos DB. It was illuminating to get a glimpse as to what companies manage and develop on a daily basis. 

This project is great as a first step, but there is still more to do. For instance, I could move blog posts like this into a Cosmos DB instead of storing a markdown file within the web app. I also need to implement tighter security for the API endpoint (not that I'm storing any sensitive data or anything, but it would be good for practice). At some point, it would also be worth my while to actually study for and take the AZ-900 exam and gain more exposure to Azure services.
