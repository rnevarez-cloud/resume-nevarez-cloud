## The Cloud Resume Challenge - Azure
---
After landing a role as a Site Reliability Engineer at Koncert, I started to look at ways I could grow my skills as an IT professional. Rather than look for an instructional course, I decided to gather inspiration for a project I could take up to learn new technology. 

This is when I stumbled upon the [Cloud Resume Challenge for Azure](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/). While I was already familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I had no idea how to deploy code to Azure or integrate it with a cloud-hosted database. It was new territory for me, but I was excited to see what I could come up with.
