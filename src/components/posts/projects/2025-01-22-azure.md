## The Cloud Resume Challenge - Azure
---
After landing a role as a Site Reliability Engineer at Koncert, I started to look at ways I could grow my skills as an IT professional. Rather than look for an instructional course, I decided to gather inspiration for a project I could take up to learn new technology. This is when I stumbled upon the [Cloud Resume Challenge for Azure](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/). While I was already familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I had no idea how to deploy code to Azure or integrate it with a cloud-hosted database. It was new territory for me, but I was excited to see what I could come up with. 

The goal was to make an exact replica of my existing resume, layout and all, but with a visitor counter at the top of the page. I also wanted to tell the user which view they were, so I had to figure out how to display an ordinal number. My experience with JavaScript outside of React was limited, so I had to do some research before I could implement this onto my site. For this initial test, I wasn't worried about how I would connect the page to an external database. My initial mockup looked like this:

```js
const english_ordinal_rules = new Intl.PluralRules("en", {type: "ordinal"});
const suffixes = {
    one: "st",
    two: "nd",
    few: "rd",
    other: "th"
};

function ordinal(number) {
    const category = english_ordinal_rules.select(number);
    console.log(category)
    const suffix = suffixes[category];
    return (number + suffix);
}

var counter = document.querySelector(".counter");
var visitCount = localStorage.getItem("page_view");

if (visitCount) {
    visitCount = Number(visitCount) + 1;
    localStorage.setItem("page_view", visitCount);
  } else {
    visitCount = 1;
    localStorage.setItem("page_view", 1);
  }
 
displayCount = ordinal(visitCount)

counter.innerHTML = displayCount;
```
